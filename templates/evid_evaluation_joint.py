instruction="You will get as input a reference evidence ([REF]) and a predicted evidence ([PRED]). [IMG_1], [IMG_2] ... are placeholders for images. Two facts may be textually aligned. But if they have different images, the two facts could be irrelevant.\n"
instruction+="Please verify the correctness of the predicted evidence by comparing it to the reference evidence, following these steps:\n"
instruction+="1. Evaluate each fact in the predicted evidence individually: is the fact supported by the REFERENCE evidence? Do not use additional sources or background knowledge.\n"
instruction+="2. Evaluate each fact in the reference evidence individually: is the fact supported by the PREDICTED evidence? Do not use additional sources or background knowledge.\n"
instruction+="3. Finally summarise (1.) how many predicted facts are supported by the reference evidence and explanations([PRED in REF] and [PRED in REF Exp]), (2.) how many reference facts are supported by the predicted evidence and explanations ([REF in PRED] and [REF in PRED Exp]).\nGenerate the output as shown in the examples below:\n"

exp_first="[PRED]: 1. The missle in [IMG_1] is Fateh 110. 2. Ilan Omar has attended the training in [IMG_2]. 3. Prince Phillip wore the Royal Guard uniform in Jan. 14, 2003. 4.The raid in Washington took place on Saturday, Oct. 26, 1999.\n"
exp_first+="[REF]: 1. [IMG_1] was taken in Jan. 20, 2003. 2. No evidence can be found related to the type of missle in [IMG_2]. 3. The woman in [IMG_3] for a training is not Ilan Omar. 4. No answer was found regarding when the raid in Washington took place. 5. Prince Phillip wore the Royal Guard uniform shown in [IMG_4] previously in Jan. 2003.\n"
exp_first+="[PRED in REF]: 1\n"
exp_first+="[PRED in REF Exp]: 1. It is refuted by the second fact in the predicted evidence set. 2. No related facts can be found in the reference set. Though the text part of the thrid fact in the reference set is similar to it, they have different images. 3. The fact is supported by the fifth fact in the evidence set. 4. It is refuted by the fourth fact in the reference evidence set.\n"
exp_first+="[REF in PRED]: 0\n"
exp_first+="[REF in PRED Exp]: 1. No related facts can be found in the reference set. Though the textual part of the fact aligns with the third fact in the predicted evidence, they have different images. 2. It is refuted by the first fact in the predicted evidence set. 3. No related facts can be found in the reference set. Though the text part of the second fact in the predicted evidence set is similar to it, they have different images. 4. It is refuted by the fourth fact in the predicted evidence which claims the date of the raid could be found. 5.  No related facts can be found in the reference set.  Though the text part of the third fact in the predicted evidence set is similar to it, they have different images.\n"

exp_second="[PRED]: 1. [IMG_1] was taken on Jan. 19, 2025. 2. The current view of the benches in [IMG_2] is [IMG_3]. 3. The date of the claim is Nov. 22, 2023.\n" 
exp_second+="[REF]: 1. The claim was made on Jan. 22, 2021. 2. [IMG_2] was taken on Jan. 19, 2025. 3. The benches in [IMG_1] currently look like [IMG_3]. 4.Trump dressed as [IMG_1] in the meeting.\n"
exp_second+="[PRED in REF]: 2\n"
exp_second+="[PRED in REF Exp]: 1. The second piece of evidence in the reference evidence supports it. 2. The third evidence in the evidence set has a similar meaning to this fact. 3. The fact claims the date as Nov. 22, 2023, which is different from the first fact in the refence evidence, Jan. 22, 2021.\n"
exp_second+="[REF in PRED]: 2\n"
exp_second+="[REF in PRED Exp]: 1. The fact claims the date as Jan. 22, 2021, which is different from the third fact in the predicted evidence, Nov. 22, 2023. 2. It is supported by the first fact in the predicted evidence. 3. It is supported by the third fact in the predicted evidence. 4. No related facts can be found in the predicted evidence set.\n\nReturn the output in the exact format as specified in the examples, do not generate any additional output:\n\n"
