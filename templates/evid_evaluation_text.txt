You will get as input a reference evidence ([REF]) and a predicted evidence ([PRED]). [IMG_1], [IMG_2] .. are placeholders for images and they are regared as the same text token.
Please verify the correctness of the predicted evidence by comparing it to the reference evidence, following these steps:
1. Evaluate each fact in the predicted evidence individually: is the fact supported by the REFERENCE evidence? Do not use additional sources or background knowledge.
2. Evaluate each fact in the reference evidence individually: is the fact supported by the PREDICTED evidence? Do not use additional sources or background knowledge.
3. Finally summarise (1.) how many predicted facts are supported by the reference evidence and explanations([PRED in REF] and [PRED in REF Exp]), (2.) how many reference facts are supported by the predicted evidence and explanations ([REF in PRED] and [REF in PRED Exp]).
